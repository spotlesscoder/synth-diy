# Lattice

##### What is this?

A through-hole only clone of the Mutable Instruments [Grids](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/grids/) module. This is <u>UNTESTED</u> - while layout is done, I have no idea if this will actually work.

##### How much power does it use?

No idea. When known, fill in the blanks. Add notes for powering by +12v and powering by +5v.

As measured by the joranalogue Test 3, around x mA on +12v and y mA on -12v at peak. The 5v rail is (more words)

##### Where does the design come from?

From the Mutable Instruments github pages, [Grids](https://github.com/pichenettes/eurorack/tree/master/grids) 

##### Are there any rare/weird parts used?

The push button is a little hard to find, but still in production (LP4OA1PBCT). You will also need an Arduino Nano.

##### Are there any problems with the design?

No idea, this is <u>UNTESTED</u>

##### Do you have a BOM/Mouser cart/Tayda links?

Sorry, no. Things go out of stock so frequently it'd be a lot of work to keep these up to date. Everything in this project is easy to source though, so you should not have any trouble.

##### Can I buy PCBs or a kit?

Send me an email (twigathy+synth@gmail.com)...

(Add some rendered images of the panel and back of PCB(s) once design is validated good)
