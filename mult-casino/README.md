# Mult Casino

##### What is this?

A clocked signal router which will route signals from the input to one or more random outputs

##### How much power does it use?

(TBC!) As measured by the joranalogue Test 3, around x mA on +12v and y mA on -12v at peak. The 5v rail is unused.

##### Where does the design come from?

This one's all me!

##### Are there any rare/weird parts used?

A Teensy 3.2 is needed, along with 3x DS1882 audio muting chips.

##### Are there any problems with the design?

There was one mistake on the PCB, details in the build guide. You'll need to cut two traces and re-route them.

##### Do you have a BOM/Mouser cart/Tayda links?

Sorry, no. Things go out of stock so frequently it'd be a lot of work to keep these up to date. Everything in this project is easy to source though, so you should not have any trouble.

##### Can I buy PCBs or a kit?

Send me an email (twigathy+synth@gmail.com)...
