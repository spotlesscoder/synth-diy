# Logic - BOM

This is the bill of materials for the Logic module. I have broken it up into SMT and Through-hole parts, as you'll probably want to solder all of the SMT parts first or have them pre-soldered.

The BOM is also available as a collated CSV.

Depending on which logical operation you want to perform, you will need a different logic chip!

| Logical Operation | IC   |

| NAND              | 4011 |
| XOR               | 4070 |
| OR                | 4071 |
| XNOR              | 4077 |
| AND               | 4081 |
