# Sycamore - Assembly - 7 Segment Alternate Mounting Option

If you want to mount the 7 segment displays for Sycamore flush with the panel, you can do so by mounting them onto some SIL sockets. This takes a little more work, is a bit more fiddly, and owing to the tolerances of both the LED displays and the cutouts in the panel may require some careful filing to increase the size of the panel cutout.

##### 7-segment display headers

Insert the 7-segment displays' pins into 5-pin SIL sockets.

##### Mounting 7-segment displays into the panel

Insert the 7-segment displays with their SIL sockets into the cutout at the top of the panel. They should fit side by side, with the decimal points at the bottom.

This is a press fit, and owing to the tolerances of the panel and the 7-segment displays, can be quite tight. If you find that the 7-segment displays just won't fit inside the panel, with a file or some sandpaper, remove a bit of the offending PCB panel material. This stuff really isn't good to breathe in, so please do make sure you do this outside!

##### Securing front panel parts

Follow the same procedure as the assembly guide, locating the 7 segment display's SIL socket pins into their holes. Once you're done, the front panel should have all parts mounted like this...

##### Soldering the 7 segment displays

Solder the 7-segment displays, top-center in this photo, then follow the rest of the front panel assembly instructions from the main assembly guide.
