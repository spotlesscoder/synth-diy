# Sycamore - Kit BOM

This is the bill of materials for the Sycamore module's Kit.

For full kits the SMT parts will already be soldered and are omitted, with the exception of the mode LEDs.

##### Customisation

Should you wish to customise your Sycamore:

- The jacks used are Thonkiconn jacks and will accept alternative nuts

- Different SMT LEDs may be used for the mode display

- The mode button can be swapped for other colours of D6RXX F1 LFS switch

- The round clock/seed/mutate LED buttons (LP4OA1PBCTG) may be swapped for other LED colours, although anything other than green tends to be hard to find

- The 7 segment display (LSHD-7801) is only produced in green, however any 0.3 inch/7.62mm digit height display should work
