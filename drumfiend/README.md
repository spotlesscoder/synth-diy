# Drumfiend

##### What is this?

A 19-channel trigger-to-MIDI processor. Send it triggers, and it'll send out MIDI notes.

##### How much power does it use?

As measured by the Joranalogue Test 3, around 40 mA on +12v. The 5v and -12v rails are unused. As LED start to light up, power use goes up a little bit - in the very worst case with all 20 LEDs lit, probably around 50mA.

##### Where does the design come from?

This one's all me! The basic MIDI-out (ie. two resistors) was taken from the excellent [Teensy MIDI documentation.](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_MIDI.html)

##### Are there any rare/weird parts used?

You will need a Teensy4.0 and a Stereo Thonkiconn to build the module.

Most of the parts are SMT. Any transistor of the proper type ought to work, I picked the parts that I did based purely on what was available for assembly at JLCPCB.

##### Are there any problems with the design?

Nope, all works nicely!

##### Do you have a BOM/Mouser cart/Tayda links?

Sorry, no. Things go out of stock so frequently it'd be a lot of work to keep these up to date. Everything in this project is easy to source though, so you should not have any trouble.

##### Can I buy PCBs or a kit?

Available as a [DIY Kit](https://www.tindie.com/products/divergentwaves/logic/) from Tindie
